Developed by [@DoktorSAS](https://twitter.com/DoktorSAS), all the credit goes to him for doing all of the work.


## Usage
The organization of the page shows where the files are to be placed. 
The entire mp_mapvote/zm_mapvote folders are mods that should be compiled and used as mods.

As for the T7x project, only the compiled file can be uploaded. Just put the file in the correct path.
In mp_mapvote it should be put in `Unranked Server/scripts/mp/gametypes/` while for zm_mapvote it should be put in `Unranked Server/scripts/zm/gametypes/ `.

To make edits to the configuration of the Map Vote mod, edit your Server Configs respectively.
